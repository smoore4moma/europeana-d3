# europeana-d3
A d3.js implementation using the Europeana API

This is the code used to create this demo: <a href="http://www.europeana-d3.info" target="_blank">www.europeana-d3.info</a>

The bulk of this code is totally unnecessary!  It is what you get when you start a new empty MVC project in Visual Studio.  I only used this in order to have a bootstrap theme and MVC structure up and running quickly.  In fact I removed all login code in order to simplify the project.

The main code is maintained in just one file - [connections.js](Europeana-D3/Scripts/app/connections.js).   The file is javascript so it can be used with any technology.  Note that you will need an API key from <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/" target="_blank">Europeana Labs</a> in order to use this application.  Just change the first line of [connections.js](Europeana-D3/Scripts/app/connections.js).
