# europeana-d3
A d3.js implementation using the Europeana API

This is the code used to create this demo:  http://www.europeana-d3.info.

The bulk of this code is totally unnecessary!  It is what you get when you start a new empty MVC project in Visual Studio.  I only used this in order to have a bootstrap theme and MVC structure up and running quickly.  In fact I removed all login web parts in order to simplify the project.

The main code is maintained in just one file - [connections.js](Europeana-D3/Scripts/app/connections.js).   The file is javascript so it can be used with any technology.  Note that you will need an API key from [Europeana Labs](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/) in order to use this application.  Just change the first line of connections.js.
